# CS-230-Singleton-Game-Service

The Gaming Room is a video game company with an Android app, Draw It or Lose It, a game where a stock drawing is slowly rendered, and the players try to guess what is being drawn. The Gaming Room would like to create a web-based version of their game, and they need some help setting up the environment. </br>
