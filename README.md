# CS-230-Singleton-Game-Service

The Gaming Room is a video game company with an Android app, Draw It or Lose It, a game where a stock drawing is slowly rendered, and the players try to guess what is being drawn. The Gaming Room would like to create a web-based version of their game, and they need some help setting up the environment. </br>

In developing This software design doccument, I did well when it came  to describing the propsed strucutre of the game service. Additionally, I did well in my platform evaluations and reccomendation. I felt quite comfortable creating the UML diagram as well and found lucid chart to be a very intuitive tool. However, I struggled with the Design constraints. When it comes to writing design constraints, I find myself often re-iterating the design requirements. My first attempt at design constraints are not my first draft. I have revised them. I beleive that this new set of constraints are more in-line with what design constraints should represent. </br>
